# Disclone

> The Educational Discord Clone

Discord is a service that allows a large community of online individuals to come together and communicate freely about many different topics, such as video games, school/university, work, etc. Many online services such as Reddit, Twitter, among others, allow users to interact with each other in a forum or thread format. Discord's innovative approach allowed users to interact with each other in real-time. Disclone is an educational exploration that aims to connect users intuitively using this established approach of real-time chat while using a more friendly UI.

## Developing

Here's how to get started looking at the source code and developing locally:

- This application was developed using Docker + Compose. If you do not have Docker Desktop already installed, please visit the [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) site, create an account if you wish, and install it.

- Next, clone this repository to your local machine with the following command:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/CP-DISCLONE/disclone.git
  ```

- Navigate to the `scripts` directory and run the following commands to install application dependencies locally:

  ```bash
  chmod +x ./install.sh # Makes the script executable on your machine
  ./install.sh # Installs project dependencies
  ```

- Finally, navigate back to the root `disclone` directory and run the following commands:
  ```bash
  docker compose build # Builds the images for containers
  docker compose up # Spins up the containers
  docker compose down # After you exit the containers and wish to bring them down
  ```

## Purpose

> The Educational Benefits of this Application

This project was a way for our group to implement many new concepts that we had little experience working with. Creating our own asnychronous application with Django Channels and Redis was a challenge, but we gained a lot of knowledge doing so. If you would like to see more about the project structure and architecture, please see: [Architecture](./docs/architecture.md).
