# Disclone

This is Disclone, an educational project that mimics and further develops the Discord chat service.

## Background

Discord is a service that allows a large community of online individuals to come together and communicate freely about many different topics, such as video games, school/university, work, etc. Many online services such as Reddit, Twitter, among others, allow users to interact with each other in a forum or thread format. Discord's innovative approach allowed users to interact with each other in real-time. Disclone aims to connect users intuitively using this established approach of real-time chat while using a more friendly UI.

## Purpose

This project was a way for our group to implement many new concepts that we had little experience working with. Creating our own asnychronous application with Django Channels and Redis was a challenge, but we gained a lot of knowledge doing so. If you would like to see more about the project structure and architecture, please see: ==architecture documentation==.
